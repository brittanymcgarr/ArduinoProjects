# ArduinoProjects

Collection of small Arduino projects.

LaunchPad: Created for the Reno Air Races, this platform responds to serial I/O from the keyboard and adjusts
           a set of linear actuators positioned at each corner of a landing pad. The event will be for autonomous
           drone landing demonstrations and may be extended to include crosswinds and macro commands.
           
Sadness's Memory Orb: Created for 2015 Halloween based on the movie, Pixar's "Inside Out." In the movie, the 
           Sadness character accidentally changes memories when she touches them, changing them to blue. The
           memory orb performs similarly, changing colors based on the read temperature of the holder.
